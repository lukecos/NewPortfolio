                <h1>Outline</h1>
            <p>The goal of this design challenge was to redesign the information architecture and homepage layout for Head Start Homes, a non-profit organization. They’re a charity assisting disadvantaged Australians to secure their first homes in an effort to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. <br> Our team took an agile development approach based on the project timeline and scope, managing tasks using Trello and utilizing the double diamond design process throughout.</p>

                <h1>Discover</h1>
                <p>Initial research included conducting usability testing with the current Head Start Homes homepage/navigation and gaining responses from a developed survey to be analyzed. Additionally we were able to secure an interview with the CEO by reaching out on LinkedIn. This stakeholder confirmed the purpose of the website and provided annual report documentation that was yet to be made public, while sharing his preferences as to the overall redesign.</p>

This confirmed some of our assumptions but importantly gave insight to the true intention and goal of the website. Rather then viewed as a medium for gathering donations as initially thought, our research uncovered credibility and trustworthiness as the key factors the website set out to achieve.</p>

                <p>Using the gained insights to create some sketch wireframes for potential homepage layouts, our team each proposed different designs. Collaborating online in this way meant the chosen design contained a culmination of features and ideas after extensive discussion and comparison. Our Low-Fi prototypes were then usability tested, with results being analyzed for iterations to take place.</p>

Presenting our design to the class, showcasing the before and after result of our combined design skills and collaborative efforts. Increasing the aesthetics and legibility to abide by AA accessibility standards while providing clear credibility through the presence of charity partner logos.</p>
